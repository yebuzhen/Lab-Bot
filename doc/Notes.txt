Comparisons between RabbitMQ and MySQL in implementing Lab-Bot:


RabbitMQ's functions and advantages:
1. Various APIs and plugins, friendly for web-based service and software-based(Java) service.
2. Asynchronous messaging supported. RabbitMQ can easily handle multiple producers and consumers.
3. Flexible routing to queues, various exchange type.

RabbitMQ's restrictions and disadvantages:
1. Impossible to know the specific item's position in the queue.
2. Hard to peak the queue (Need to manually acknowledge the message).
3. RabbitMQ Web STOMP Plugin has very limited functions.
4. Items in the queue can only contain character strings.


MySQL's functions and advantages:
1. Works very well in web-based service with php.
2. All data can be stored in one place (MySQL).
3. Easy to peek the queue.
4. Easy to build relations between tables (foreign keys).
5. Easy to know one specific item's position in the queue.
6. The object in the queue can contain multiple data.
7. Easy to archive messages.

MySQL's restrictions and disadvantages:
1. Hard to fetch queue message quickly.
2. Need to manually handle asynchronous messaging.
3. Need to set time interval JavaScript functions to update statues.
